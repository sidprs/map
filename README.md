- Program is run on RaspberryPI armed with custom GPU drivers to display graphics on LCD Display.
- Map powered by GPS module / LiDAR modules that will give traffic decisions. (in progress) 
- Utilizing imgui framework for creating new destinations / step routes.
- Creating new visual diagram of a finite state diagram to show the state of the device while on route.
    - DFA will describe the state of the device
